        Another
        island that reeks of betrayal.


        CAPTAIN

        The spyglass of
        the navigator should be around here somewhere. We won''t even reach the shore
        of where we''re going without it.


        NARRATION

        You only make
        it a few steps inland before a ghostly presence appears before you!


        FLORRIE

        Well,
        look what has washed up with the tides.


        FLORRIE

        You ought
        to give up piracy and return to that fishing raft of yours. This captain
        will be no help to your livelihood.

        Florrie you

        pitiful island as this!

        My new crew may be modest
        in size but is a great improvement in the loyalty department, as you should
        know.


        FLORRIE

        I expect your heart would have fed the bottom-feeders
        in your watery grave well, had you not lost it so long before your demise.


        CAPTAIN

        Hearsay!
        Speak not of hearts to me you accursed mutineer!


        FLORRIE

        Traitor?
        The only traitor here is you. You long ago abandoned a love of sea, comradery
        and adventure for love of gold.


        CAPTAIN

        With crewmates
        like you, I''d prefer the company of gold. Give us your spyglass, traitor.


        FLORRIE

        You
        entrusted it to me once with my judgement, and it remains in that state.
        My judgement is to refuse your command.


        CAPTAIN

        Refusing
        your captain can get you quickly to the end of a plank, not that I had the
        chance when it mattered most!

        CAPTAIN

        You

        She
        is still crying, but you see a slight smile.


        FLORRIE

        It
        is true. I was as obsessed with the map room as you are now with gold.


        FLORRIE

        Perhaps
        if we both lifted our heads up more we could have seen what the rest of the
        crew had planned for us all.


        CAPTAIN

        ...?


        FLORRIE

        You
        have given me what I need to free myself of this place. Take the spyglass,
        and go.


        FLORRIE

        Go get your gold, captain. Perhaps there
        you''ll see what a fool you are.

        With the spyglass cutting through the fog and the
        latern revealing the hidden contents of the map, your raft creeps up against
        the shoreline.


        CAPTAIN

        Oh how I''ve longed to set foot
        on you once more, my dear island!


        NARRATION

        The captain
        snatches the map and lantern from your hands and begins marching.


        CAPTAIN

        You''re
        about to witness a sight few have had the privelege of seeing. No greater
        fortune has ever been amassed on the high seas.


        NARRATION

        The
        march proceeds mostly in silence, a rare case for the captain in your journey
        so far.


        NARRATION

        To your surprise, the captain begins
        to slow down. His steps are no longer full of the enthusiasm he had jumping
        off the raft.


        NARRATION

        Finally, he comes to a stop after
        catching sight the moon resting over the ocean horizon.


        CAPTAIN

        ...


        CAPTAIN

        You''re
        not getting the full experience here you know.


        CAPTAIN

        You
        pilot a miserable raft. Have you ever sailed with a full crew?


        CAPTAIN

        The
        coordination is remarkable. Sea battles are strategy, but one can only strategize
        effectively when the crew is consistent.


        CAPTAIN

        ...


        CAPTAIN

        Bah!
        Small crew or large, the old crew chose to be looters! And here we are, a
        mere crew of two having accomplished what they failed to do!


        CAPTAIN

        I
        must admit. You would fare poorly in a sea battle.


        CAPTAIN

        ...


        CAPTAIN

        Alone,
        I mean. A good sailor knows themselves and their mates form more than the
        sum of their parts.


        CAPTAIN

        ... you should get a fishing
        buddy or something.


        CAPTAIN

        What am I saying? Get back
        to marching landlubber, break''s over!


        NARRATION

        He abruptly
        begins marching, returning his eyes to the map.


        CAPTAIN

        Gold
        in the moonlight! That''s what being a pirate is all about!


        NARRATION

        He
        is completely ignoring you.


        CAPTAIN

        They couldn''t earn
        their keep and decided to take it from their dear old captain! Ha!


        CAPTAIN

        Greed!
        That''s what did those bastards in, and brought them to their watery grave!

        You''re getting a field promotion. For exceptional

        CAPTAIN

        You''re first mate now. Better find
        someone to boss around.


        CAPTAIN

        Maybe buying someone a
        drink with some of that gold would help?


        CAPTAIN

        Take
        it from a lonely captain. Buying folks a drink is a great way to gather up
        a crew.


        CAPTAIN

        ...

        Better
        yet, a great way to gather up others to grow closer to.

        Me,
        I''ve had my time. I''m through being captain.


        CAPTAIN

        I
        had it and even when I almost lost it all, I went ahead and made sure I lost
        everything.


        CAPTAIN

        Me best mates. And I threw their lot
        in with those I would curse beyond the grave.

        I''m
        through with it. I''m though with being a captain, and I''m through with
        being anything.


        NARRATION

        His ghostly body begins to fade,
        like Florrie and Leftpaw did.


        CAPTAIN

        Maybe... maybe I
        ought to try fishing?


        NARRATION

        Your captain is gone.

        At

        You barely walk a few meters before you see the entrace

        It''ll

        As
