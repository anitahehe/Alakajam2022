        FLORRIE

        Traitor?

        and adventure for love of gold.

        With crewmates
        like you, I''d prefer the company of gold. Give us your spyglass, traitor.

        You
        entrusted it to me once with my judgement, and it remains in that state.
        My judgement is to refuse your command.

        Refusing

        FLORRIE

        Thank you for this funeral
        pyre. You have fulfilled my final wish.


        FLORRIE

        With the spyglass cutting through the fog and the
        latern revealing the hidden contents of the map, your raft creeps up against
        the shoreline.


        CAPTAIN

        Oh how I''ve longed to set foot
        on you once more, my dear island!


        NARRATION

        The captain
        snatches the map and lantern from your hands and begins marching.


        CAPTAIN

        You''re
        about to witness a sight few have had the privelege of seeing. No greater
        fortune has ever been amassed on the high seas.


        NARRATION

        The
        march proceeds mostly in silence, a rare case for the captain in your journey
        so far.


        NARRATION

        To your surprise, the captain begins
        to slow down. His steps are no longer full of the enthusiasm he had jumping
        off the raft.


        NARRATION

        Finally, he comes to a stop after
        catching sight the moon resting over the ocean horizon.


        CAPTAIN

        ...


        CAPTAIN

        You''re
        not getting the full experience here you know.


        CAPTAIN

        You
        pilot a miserable raft. Have you ever sailed with a full crew?


        CAPTAIN

        The
        coordination is remarkable. Sea battles are strategy, but one can only strategize
        effectively when the crew is consistent.


        CAPTAIN

        ...


        CAPTAIN

        Bah!
        Small crew or large, the old crew chose to be looters! And here we are, a
        mere crew of two having accomplished what they failed to do!


        CAPTAIN

        I
        must admit. You would fare poorly in a sea battle.


        CAPTAIN

        ...


        CAPTAIN

        Alone,
        I mean. A good sailor knows themselves and their mates form more than the
        sum of their parts.


        CAPTAIN

        ... you should get a fishing
        buddy or something.


        CAPTAIN

        What am I saying? Get back
        to marching landlubber, break''s over!


        NARRATION

        He abruptly
        begins marching, returning his eyes to the map.


        CAPTAIN

        Gold
        in the moonlight! That''s what being a pirate is all about!


        NARRATION

        He
        is completely ignoring you.


        CAPTAIN

        They couldn''t earn
        their keep and decided to take it from their dear old captain! Ha!

        Greed!
        That''s what did those bastards in, and brought them to their watery grave!
