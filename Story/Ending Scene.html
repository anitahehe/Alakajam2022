With the spyglass cutting through the fog and the latern revealing the hidden contents of the map, your raft creeps up against the shoreline.

CAPTAIN
Oh how I&#39;ve longed to set foot on you once more, my dear island!

NARRATION
The captain snatches the map and lantern from your hands and begins marching.

CAPTAIN
You&#39;re about to witness a sight few have had the privelege of seeing. No greater fortune has ever been amassed on the high seas.

NARRATION
The march proceeds mostly in silence, a rare case for the captain in your journey so far.

NARRATION
To your surprise, the captain begins to slow down. His steps are no longer full of the enthusiasm he had jumping off the raft.

NARRATION
Finally, he comes to a stop after catching sight the moon resting over the ocean horizon.

CAPTAIN
...

CAPTAIN
You&#39;re not getting the full experience here you know.

CAPTAIN
You pilot a miserable raft. Have you ever sailed with a full crew?

CAPTAIN
The coordination is remarkable. Sea battles are strategy, but one can only strategize effectively when the crew is consistent.

CAPTAIN
...

CAPTAIN
Bah! Small crew or large, the old crew chose to be looters! And here we are, a mere crew of two having accomplished what they failed to do!

CAPTAIN
I must admit. You would fare poorly in a sea battle.

CAPTAIN
...

CAPTAIN
Alone, I mean. A good sailor knows themselves and their mates form more than the sum of their parts.

CAPTAIN
... you should get a fishing buddy or something.

CAPTAIN
What am I saying? Get back to marching landlubber, break&#39;s over!

NARRATION
He abruptly begins marching, returning his eyes to the map.

CAPTAIN
Gold in the moonlight! That&#39;s what being a pirate is all about!

NARRATION
He is completely ignoring you.

CAPTAIN
They couldn&#39;t earn their keep and decided to take it from their dear old captain! Ha!

CAPTAIN
Greed! That&#39;s what did those bastards in, and brought them to their watery grave!

[[A watery grave like yours?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="A watery grave like yours?" tags="" position="1075,625" size="100,100">CAPTAIN
Don&#39;t mistake me for a victim of my own greed like those others, fool! You may be daft but at least you&#39;re not a mutineer!

CAPTAIN
Who gets the gold in the end? Me, that&#39;s who. The one who earned it!

[[You didn&#39;t earn it alone.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="You didn&#39;t earn it alone." tags="" position="1075,750" size="100,100">CAPTAIN
I earned my keep, and a crew needs a captain.

CAPTAIN
Do you know what those bastards were before I came along?

CAPTAIN
Street urchins. Whelps. Drunks. The dregs of society.

CAPTAIN
Every captain starts somewhere. Who wants to join an inexperienced captain?

CAPTAIN
I&#39;ll give you a hint. It&#39;s not the picks of the litter.

CAPTAIN
No, I made them the crew they were. I invested time and care into my crew.

CAPTAIN
Long days and late nights. A captain who spends all his time in his quarters is the captain who loses his battles.

CAPTAIN
You need a crew you can trust with your life.

[[Guess that wasn&#39;t the crew you made then.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Guess that wasn&#39;t the crew you made then." tags="" position="1075,875" size="100,100">NARRATION
The captain is dumbfounded. He stops his marching.

CAPTAIN
Don&#39;t tell me about my own crew, ye scallywag!

CAPTAIN
I taught them too well if anything! Once we could go for the big fish there was no looking back!

CAPTAIN
Royal galleons. Merchant vessels. Literal treasure ships. The amount of gold was beyond anything I had promised them.

CAPTAIN
Why shouldn&#39;t I get my fair share? They had more than enough of what they&#39;d originally agreed to.

CAPTAIN
In the beginning we had to run from sea fights! We flew up the black flag and if they didn&#39;t surrender we had to run for our lives!

CAPTAIN
If Florrie couldn&#39;t help us flee into the reefs we&#39;d have died a thousand times over!

CAPTAIN
And that&#39;s nothing if Leftpaw didn&#39;t find ways of keeping the ship afloat when god knows it took one too many cannonballs to the hull!

CAPTAIN
I remember one time we barely made it to land to do repairs, and what did we find on the deserted island we hit?

CAPTAIN
Another recent shipwreck. Rum smugglers! They had been so drunk at sea they had run the ship aground!

CAPTAIN
We all partied for days, until all the rum and rations were gone. What a fine time!

CAPTAIN
By the end we had completely fogotten about the-

NARRATION
The captain trails off.

CAPTAIN
...

CAPTAIN
Get back to marching, landlubber. We could have bought twice the rum with the gold on the ship we escaped from back then!

[[Florrie and Leftpaw didn&#39;t betray you.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Florrie and Leftpaw didn&#39;t betray you." tags="" position="1075,1000" size="100,100">NARRATION
The captain erupts into a raging stance.

CAPTAIN
They were the closest crewmates I had! I trusted them with the security of this very island!

CAPTAIN
And in the end, they betrayed me!

[[They sacrificed themselves for you.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="They sacrificed themselves for you." tags="" position="1075,1125" size="100,100">CAPTAIN
Nonsense! Balderdash!

CAPTAIN
Even if that were true, they should have kept a better eye on the crew! Mutinies don&#39;t just happen you know!

[[Gold and greed replaced you as captain.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Gold and greed replaced you as captain." tags="" position="1075,1250" size="100,100">CAPTAIN
...

CAPTAIN
Oh bugger it all.

CAPTAIN
I&#39;m this close to the gold, and you&#39;re ruining it!

CAPTAIN
I can put them all behind me! What matter is it if they had less?

CAPTAIN
If they didn&#39;t want more they would have stopped sailing!

CAPTAIN
And if they stopped sailing I wouldn&#39;t have a crew!

CAPTAIN
And if I didn&#39;t have a crew I&#39;d be-

CAPTAIN
...

CAPTAIN
All alone.

CAPTAIN
All alone with me gold.

NARRATION
The captain falls silent and in the distance you hear the crashing sounds of the waves.

CAPTAIN
...

CAPTAIN
I don&#39;t like to see it, but the treasure I&#39;ve lost is something gold can&#39;t buy.

NARRATION
The captain looks over his incorpoeal body.

CAPTAIN
...

CAPTAIN
If you had to choose, would you pick a life or a legacy?

[[Life.]]
[[Legacy.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Life." tags="" position="1075,1375" size="100,100">CAPTAIN
I guess me next question should be, &quot;would you spend your life like pirates save gold?&quot;

NARRATION
The captain passes you the lantern and map.

[[Take it.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Legacy." tags="" position="1200,1375" size="100,100">CAPTAIN
Ha! I suppose most do want to live beyond their lives. It&#39;s not what it&#39;s cracked up to be.

NARRATION
The captain passes you the lantern and map.

[[Take it.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Take it." tags="" position="1150,1500" size="100,100">CAPTAIN
You&#39;re getting a field promotion. For exceptional work at sea.

CAPTAIN
You&#39;re first mate now. Better find someone to boss around.

CAPTAIN
Maybe buying someone a drink with some of that gold would help?

CAPTAIN
Take it from a lonely captain. Buying folks a drink is a great way to gather up a crew.

CAPTAIN
...

CAPTAIN
Better yet, a great way to gather up others to grow closer to.

CAPTAIN
Me, I&#39;ve had my time. I&#39;m through being captain.

CAPTAIN
I had it and even when I almost lost it all, I went ahead and made sure I lost everything.

CAPTAIN
Me best mates. And I threw their lot in with those I would curse beyond the grave.

CAPTAIN
I&#39;m through with it. I&#39;m though with being a captain, and I&#39;m through with being anything.

NARRATION
His ghostly body begins to fade, like Florrie and Leftpaw did.

CAPTAIN
Maybe... maybe I ought to try fishing?

NARRATION
Your captain is gone.

NARRATION
At sea, command falls to those of the next highest rank. What are your orders, captain?

[[Finish the march!]]

[[Return to the boat.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Finish the march!" tags="" position="1150,1625" size="100,100">NARRATION
You barely walk a few meters before you see the entrace to a cave, the moonlight cutting through and revealing a golden glow.

NARRATION
You step inside, and within is more gold than you possible could have imagined. The cave is wider and deeper than it appears from outside.

NARRATION
You step inside, and within is more gold than you possible could have imagined. The cave is wider and deeper than it appeared from outside.

NARRATION
It&#39;ll take a few trips with your raft, but you figure you can go back and forth to accumulate enough to buy a ship of your own.

NARRATION
With your magic lantern and spyglass it will be no trouble.

NARRATION
As you lift the first handful of gold, you realize how heavy it is.

NARRATION
You can&#39;t help but think - this would be easier with a crew.

NARRATION
THE END.

NARRATION
Created for the 16th Alakajam by:

&quot;A pirate&#39;s life&#39;s not for me,&quot; you say to yourself.

NARRATION
You turn around, then remember how excited you were to possibly catch a tuna earlier.

NARRATION
... and gold can buy a lot of tuna.
