The last line is cast for the day. You enjoy the gentle sway of your boat as you take in another deep breath of the crisp sea air.

NARRATION
During your exhale, you enjoy the bright red sunset as it gently sets toward the horizon. You’re reminded of the vibrant coral back home. 

NARRATION
Suddenly, you feel a tug on your line and your mind snaps back to the present. 
You lick your lips as another fish will soon be yours!

NARRATION
You begin to reel on your rod and to your surprise you&#39;re met with stiff resistance. 
There is no doubt in your mind this is a larger fish, a sturgeon perhaps? 

NARRATION
You continue to reel, and your biceps begin to ache from your exertion.
With all this effort – you now wonder if a tuna is on the line!

NARRATION
As your line nears the boat your mind &amp; body are warring with the thought of eating this catch and forgoing the profit. 

[[I think I&#39;ll eat the fish]]
[[I need to sell this fish]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="I think I&#39;ll eat the fish" tags="" position="525,475" size="100,100">NARRATION
You can always catch another fish to sell tomorrow, and your mouth salivates while your stomach anticipates its next delicious meal.

NARRATION
You can see the catch emerge from the glistening amber waters and it&#39;s... 

[[Look closer]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="I need to sell this fish" tags="" position="725,475" size="100,100">NARRATION
Despite really needing the money and mustering up the resistance, you know which part of you is winning as your stomach growls in defiance. 

NARRATION
You can see the catch emerge from the glistening amber waters and it&#39;s... 

[[Look closer]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Look closer" tags="" position="625,625" size="100,100">NARRATION
...a ball of kelp.
You begin to deflate as disappointment washes over your body and mind.

NARRATION
As claim your catch, you notice a heft as the kelp is lowered to the deck of your raft. It hits the deck with a hollow thud. 

NARRATION
There is a glint of scarlet as you notice the reflection of something glassy from within.

NARRATION
You stick your hand within the slimy tangled knot of kelp and your nose becomes overwhelmed with the aroma of brine and earth. 

NARRATION
After some digging your hand emerges with a bottle. Something rattling within as you untangle the kelp from it. 

NARRATION
You peer inside the bottle and notice a roll of paper and determine the noise is coming from a corroded key inside housed inside.

NARRATION
You pop the cork off the bottle and notice faint blueish green gas seeping out.

NARRATION
The gas is starting to coalesce into misty tendrils and a green light begins to pulse in feint rhythm almost like a heartbeat. The key begins to glow…

[[Wait and watch]]
[[Throw the bottle into the ocean]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Wait and watch" tags="" position="562.5,750" size="100,100">NARRATION
The green spectral and ethereal ooze keeps seeping out of the key until the mist forms an incorporeal man. As it is happening, you hear faint whispers and groans of terror.

[[Er, who are you?]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Er, who are you?" tags="" position="625,875" size="100,100">NARRATION
Before you can finish your inquiry, what you begin to realize is the ghost of a pirate captain interrupts you.

CAPTAIN
Avast ye&#39; scallywag!  Yer to sail me right to Skull Island immediately. This ship here is now commandeered by yer&#39;s truly, savvy? 


[[Stay Silent]]
[[Try to form a response]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Stay Silent" tags="" position="550,1000" size="100,100">NARRATION
You stare right into the empty sockets of this ethereal Captain; he looks entirely indifferent to your existence.

NARRATION
You are utterly frozen in fear, your mouth agape. 

[[The Captain Resumes Talking]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Try to form a response" tags="" position="700,1000" size="100,100">NARRATION
You stare right into the empty sockets of this ethereal Captain; he looks entirely indifferent to your existence.  

NARRATION
You open your mouth and are jumbling and stuttering your words in fear. 

NARRATION
You give up trying to articulate and close your mouth in surrender.

[[The Captain Resumes Talking]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Cast anchor and set sail" tags="" position="625,1325" size="100,100">NARRATION
You set sail for your next destination, heading deeper into the dreaded isles. 
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Throw the bottle into the ocean" tags="" position="700,750" size="100,100">NARRATION
You hear a satisfying glub as the bottle sinks back into the ocean. A green light glows brighter and brighter under it&#39;s wake. The water begins to froth and boil as if it were growling at you.

NARRATION
The boiling reaches a climax as a bright ghastly light erupts from it and heads towards your boat. You close your eyes in fear and begin to scream in terror. 

NARRATION
When you re-open your eyes you see an incorporeal man, a ghost, sitting across from you on your raft, and hear a clank and rattle as the bottle rolls across the deck of your ship. 

[[Er, who are you?]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="The Captain Resumes Talking" tags="" position="625,1150" size="100,100">CAPTAIN
Quit being lily-livered and weigh anchor immediately! We need to get to my horde o&#39; booty before those mutinous bilge-suckers do! 

CAPTAIN
Before we can get into Skull Island we need the sapphire spyglass to see through the fog so we don’t end up fish food hitting the rocky shoreline.

CAPTAIN
We also need the amber lantern to reveal the hidden ink on my map. 

NARRATOR
He gestures to the blank parchment in the bottle.

CAPTAIN
Fortunately, I sense that these items are on the isles nearby.

CAPTAIN
If you don&#39;t comply with me orders - I will keelhaul ye across the deep. You don&#39;t realize how dark and cold it is down there. Savvy?

NARRATION
The Captain leans in toward you raising one boney hand upward and closing it in a fist. His skeletal jaw clenches. You find yourself reluctantly in agreement with his terms.
