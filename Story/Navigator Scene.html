You approach the shores of the island, and run your raft up against the beachhead to dismount onto the sand.

CAPTAIN
Another island that reeks of betrayal.

CAPTAIN
The spyglass of the navigator should be around here somewhere. We won&#39;t even reach the shore of where we&#39;re going without it.

NARRATION
You only make it a few steps inland before a ghostly presence appears before you!

FLORRIE
Well, look what has washed up with the tides.

FLORRIE
You ought to give up piracy and return to that fishing raft of yours. This captain will be no help to your livelihood.

CAPTAIN
Florrie you fiend! Justice exists after all, with a traitor like you damned to such a pitiful island as this!

CAPTAIN
My new crew may be modest in size but is a great improvement in the loyalty department, as you should know.

FLORRIE
I expect your heart would have fed the bottom-feeders in your watery grave well, had you not lost it so long before your demise.

CAPTAIN
Hearsay! Speak not of hearts to me you accursed mutineer!

FLORRIE
Traitor? The only traitor here is you. You long ago abandoned a love of sea, comradery and adventure for love of gold.

CAPTAIN
With crewmates like you, I&#39;d prefer the company of gold. Give us your spyglass, traitor.

FLORRIE
You entrusted it to me once with my judgement, and it remains in that state. My judgement is to refuse your command.

CAPTAIN
Refusing your captain can get you quickly to the end of a plank, not that I had the chance when it mattered most!

[[Florrie 2]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Florrie 2" tags="" position="1225,500" size="100,100">FLORRIE
This tires me. You, the only one here with a body. Care to assist me in my wishes?

FLORRIE
Unlike your captain here, I haven&#39;t had much company lately.

FLORRIE
I died of exposure not far from here. In my current state there&#39;s not much I could do to clean up.

FLORRIE
Long ago, after days of torturous isolation, starvation, and burning sun on my skin I woke from death to the sight of seabirds feasting on my corpse.

CAPTAIN
I can only hope you slept in and missed the last boat! No wonder the mutineers died at sea, the fools approached their final destination without the spyglass!

CAPTAIN
I imagine you wanted it all for yourself, and were so excited you forgot to pack an escape boat to row over their corpses with. Fool!

FLORRIE
Silence. Go fetch my corpse, unless you&#39;d prefer to listen to an eternity of your dear captain&#39;s musings.

[[In trade for the spyglass?]]
[[Why?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="What must I do?" tags="" position="1325,775" size="100,100">FLORRIE
I have reason to be upset you know.

FLORRIE
The crew once sailed the high seas in constant companionship. One grows to appreciate the company on a ship.

FLORRIE
I only set out to sea for a legacy worth remembering. I only stayed out there to be among those who cared for me and I for them.

CAPTAIN
Your disingenuity even after death is despicable.

FLORRIE
When I was stranded here all I wanted was the old crew to appear on the horizon to rescue me.

FLORRIE
I&#39;d have given anything for even one trusted shipmate to have been with me for the end.

FLORRIE
Instead I passed alone. Are you getting the picture your captain is so clearly missing?

[[What is your intent?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="In trade for the spyglass?" tags="" position="1425,625" size="100,100">FLORRIE
There hasn&#39;t been anything to see, why would I need it? There&#39;s not a soul around apart from me until you two arrived.

[[What must I do?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="What is your intent?" tags="" position="1325,900" size="100,100">FLORRIE
Bring my body back here and light a pyre with some driftwood.

FLORRIE
I died alone. I shall at least have attendees to my funeral.

[[Very well.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Very well." tags="" position="1325,1025" size="100,100">NARRATION
You go inland and retrieve the bones and apparel of Florrie, gather it with some driftwood on the beach, and light it on fire.

CAPTAIN
Those seabirds pecking at your corpse were the best funeral guests a traitor like you deserves Florrie.

FLORRIE
Thank you for this funeral pyre. You have fulfilled my final wish.

FLORRIE
Perhaps, in this moment you could set aside your blinding greed and eulogize me like you once promised, my captain?

CAPTAIN
I don&#39;t recall ever making such a promise.

NARRATION
An expression crosses Florries face that shows the captain&#39;s words cut deep.

FLORRIE
I see. Well, I know what it&#39;s like to be forgotten just like that promise.

NARRATION
She is fighting tears. Seeing this, captain&#39;s smug look of self-righteousness appears to have weakened.

CAPTAIN
...

CAPTAIN
You earned your monachre, Florrie the Straight. Not once were we lost at sea.

NARRATION
She is still crying, but you see a slight smile.

FLORRIE
It is true. I was as obsessed with the map room as you are now with gold.

FLORRIE
Perhaps if we both lifted our heads up more we could have seen what the rest of the crew had planned for us all.

CAPTAIN
...?

FLORRIE
You have given me what I need to free myself of this place. Take the spyglass, and go.

FLORRIE
Go get your gold, captain. Perhaps there you&#39;ll see what a fool you are.

NARRATION
She fades and dissapears. You feel spyglass appear in your hands.

CAPTAIN
...

CAPTAIN
Back to sea. Captain&#39;s orders.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Why?" tags="" position="1275,625" size="100,100">FLORRIE
Why? Because I have the spyglass you need. Doesn&#39;t that appeal to your sense of loyalty to your captain, or is there hope for you yet?
