The tide is calm making your approach straightforward. A moment of solace for this first time during this journey.

NARRATION
You realize the captain has been quiet for some time as he is fixated on a distant blue witch light.

NARRATION
You approach the shores of the island and run your raft up against the beachhead to dismount onto the sand.

NARRATION
You watch the sea foam bubbling across the shore as you drag your vessel deeper on the beach. You leave it unanchored with no worry of the tide.

CAPTAIN
This island reeks of betrayal.

CAPTAIN
The spyglass of my ol’ navigator should be around here somewhere. We won&#39;t even reach the shore of where we&#39;re going without it.

NARRATION
You only make it a few steps inland before you find the human remains clutching a spyglass. 

NARRATION
As you reach for it blue light swirls and coalesces in front of you – it as blinding as a full moon across a calm sea. 

FLORRIE
Well, look what has washed up with the tides.

FLORRIE
You ‘ought to give up piracy and return to that fishing raft of yours. This captain will be no help to your livelihood.

CAPTAIN
Florrie you fiend! 

NARRATION
The captain reaches for his cutlass. 

CAPTAIN
With a scurvy dog like ye thrice-damned to such a pitiful island as this, justice exists after all!

CAPTAIN
My new crew may be modest in size but is a great improvement in the loyalty department, as a traitor like ye should know.

FLORRIE
I expect your heart would have fed the bottom-feeders in your watery grave well, had you not lost it so long before your demise.

CAPTAIN
Hearsay! Speak not of hearts to me ye accursed mutineer!

FLORRIE
The only traitor here is you. You long ago abandoned a love of sea, comradery, and adventure for love of gold. It poisoned you captain. 

CAPTAIN
With crewmates like ye, I&#39;d prefer the company of gold. Give us yer spyglass, traitor.

FLORRIE
You entrusted it to me once with my judgement, and it remains under my protection. My judgement is to refuse your command.

CAPTAIN
Refusing yer captain can get you quickly to the end of a plank! I wish I had the chance when it mattered most, but this’ll do! 

[[The spyglass looks broken…]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="What must I do?" tags="" position="1325,775" size="100,100">FLORRIE
I have reason to be distraught you know.

FLORRIE
The crew once sailed the high seas in constant companionship. One grows to appreciate the company on a ship. You could say we were a family of sorts.

FLORRIE
I originally set out to sea for a legacy worth remembering. I only stayed out there to be among those who cared for me and I for them.

CAPTAIN
Yer commitment to run a rig even after death is despicable.

NARRATOR
She ignores the captain’s interjection and continues.

FLORRIE
When I was stranded here all I wanted was the old crew to appear on the horizon to rescue me.

FLORRIE
I&#39;d have given anything for even one trusted shipmate to have been with me for the end. If only…

FLORRIE
Instead, I passed alone, with no legacy left behind. Are you getting the picture your captain is so clearly missing?

[[What is your intent?]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="What is your intent?" tags="" position="1325,900" size="100,100">FLORRIE
Light a pyre with some driftwood and burn my remains on it.

FLORRIE
I died alone. I shall at least have attendees to my funeral. I deserve as much.

NARRATOR
She gazes toward the Captain, who stands there expressionless. 

[[Very well.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Very well." tags="" position="1325,1025" size="100,100">NARRATION
You go inland and retrieve driftwood from the beach and collect scattered apparel and the remaining belongings of Florrie the Navigator.

NARRATION
You hear Florrie and the Captain talking as you return and set to work on building a pyre. 

CAPTAIN
Ye were too quick to pack a duffle and show the dungbie of a dinghy as ye sailed away.

CAPTAIN
Those seabirds pecking at yer corpse were the best funeral wake a traitor like ye deserves Florrie.

FLORRIE
I did it to deny the mutineers the spyglass you seadog. There figured out its importance. 

NARRATION
Florrie turns to you as you ready to light the pyre with your tinder box. A profound mix of sadness and relief washes across her ghastly face.

FLORRIE
Thank you for this funeral pyre. You have fulfilled my final wish.

FLORRIE
Captain, perhaps in this moment you could set aside your blinding greed and eulogize me like you once promised?

CAPTAIN
I don&#39;t recall ever making such a promise.

NARRATION
An expression crosses Florries face showing the captain&#39;s words cut deep.

FLORRIE
I see. Well, I know what it&#39;s like to be forgotten just like that promise.

NARRATION
She is fighting tears. Seeing this, captain&#39;s smug look of self-righteousness appears to have weakened across his skullish expression.

CAPTAIN
...

CAPTAIN
You earned your title, Florrie the Straight. Not once were we lost at sea. A captain couldn’t ask for a better navigator. 

NARRATION
A few tears roll down her face, the motes of blue ectoplasm dissolving into the sand below. You see a slight smile. You start to see her fade as more parts dissolve into the ground below.

FLORRIE
It is true. I was as obsessed with the map room as you are now with gold.

FLORRIE
Perhaps if we both lifted our heads up more, we could have seen what the rest of the crew had planned for us all.

CAPTAIN
...?

FLORRIE
You have given me what I need to free myself of this place. Take the spyglass and go.

FLORRIE
Go get your gold, captain. Perhaps there you&#39;ll see what a fool you are.

NARRATION
She continues to fade in a gentle waterfall of azure light gracefully pooling below her pyre.

NARRATION
You feel spyglass appear in your hands, now complete with its sapphire lens whole again.

CAPTAIN
...

NARRATION
The Captain stows his cutlas and stiffens up. 

CAPTAIN
Back to sea. Captain&#39;s orders.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Why?" tags="" position="1275,625" size="100,100">

FLORRIE
You’re as daft as the mutineers. Why? Because I’m the only one that can fix the spyglass you need. 

FLORRIE
Doesn&#39;t that appeal to your sense of loyalty to your ‘captain’, or is there hope for you yet?

[[What must I do?]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="The spyglass looks broken…" tags="" position="1075,600" size="100,100">FLORRIE
This tires me. You, the only one here with a body. 

NARRATOR
Florrie turns to face you and for the first time you can see her distinguished presence. Without a doubt, she is the most intelligent being on the island built from an education in life.

NARRATOR
There are stashes of charts holstered at her hip presumably of all the archipelagos the Scarlet Siren sailed. Her hair floats in the air as if she was a drowned corpse adrift in water.

FLORRIE
Care to assist me in my wishes?

FLORRIE
Unlike your captain here, I haven&#39;t had much company lately.

FLORRIE
As you can see, I died of exposure here. Marooned alone on this island. In my current state there&#39;s not much I could do to clean up.

FLORRIE
Long ago, following days of torturous isolation, starvation, and burning sun on my skin I woke from death to the sight of seabirds feasting on my corpse.

CAPTAIN
I hope this was because ye slept in and missed the last boat! No wonder the mutineers died at sea, the fools approached their final destination without the spyglass!

NARRATOR
The Captain lets out a cackle as he casually waves the cutlass in his hand.

CAPTAIN
I imagine ye wanted it all for yourself ye greedy harlot and were so excited ye forgot to pack an escape boat to row over their corpses with. Yer a scallywag!

FLORRIE
Silence my Captain. You there, go fetch my corpse, unless you&#39;d prefer to listen to an eternity of your dear captain&#39;s musings.

[[But the spyglass is broken...]]
[[Why?]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="But the spyglass is broken..." tags="" position="1100,725" size="100,100">FLORRIE
You’re a keen one, not nearly as daft as you look. I’m the only one that can fix the spyglass you need. 

FLORRIE
Doesn&#39;t that appeal to your sense of loyalty to your ‘captain’, or is there hope for you yet?
